# Digital Humans ( 2022 )

In this repository, you fill find snippets of code that you can reuse for your projects. We have built this repository as a way to demonstrate how you can make an interface that allows you add/remove information from lists. Once you have mastered that, you will find example of how we use lists to feed a machine learning model that has been trained. 

Some of what you will learn while using this repository will "seem" to skip some crucials steps, like understanding Javascript. In this repository I intend to demonstrate that Vue.js is actually an ideal starting point for designers
to learn the most important elements of creating an application. After completing the lessons included here, you will learn:

- the structure of any static webpage ( even instagram.com )
- the structure of a function ( how to make something happen )
- the structure of a simple listing app ( any app that gather )
- how to use machine learning libraries to make classifications
- how to use machine learning libraries to make predictions
- how to connect your machine learing device to a web interface

## Things To Do

- [-] Vanilla HTML/CSS Example (see index.html)
- [-] Maing your page dynamic with Vue.js (see app.html)


## Libraries you will learn how to use:
- Uikit - A tool for making your web pages pretty, right from the start.
- Axios - A tool for making requests to other places on the internet, within your application
- ML5 - A tool for working with machine learning in your browser based app.
