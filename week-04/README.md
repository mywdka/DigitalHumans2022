# Training a voice recognition model for the Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense

## Edge impulse

Training a voice recognition model from scratch for the [Arduino](arduino.cc/en/Guide/Introduction) can be a difficult task. Luckily there are services like Edge Impulse that makes this task a lot easier. In class we will be using Edge Impulse to collect data (sound), train a voice recognition model (keyword spotting), test the trained model and eventually deploy (upload) the model on the Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense. This `README` will be updated in the near future with a written and video tutorial of the contents covered in class.

## Getting started
