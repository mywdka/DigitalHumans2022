# Starter

This `starter` folder contains the Arduino Sketch (program) `keyword_recognition.ino` that we will use to run your trained Edge Impulse model on the Arduino Nano BLE 33 Sense. We will also use the built-in BLE (Bluetooth Low Engergy) module of the Arduino to make a connection and send data over to the web app we are going to build in `week-05`.
